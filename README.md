#Virtual Environment Setup

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus several additional packages.

Why Use a Virtual Environment?
Isolation: Virtual environments allow you to isolate project dependencies from other projects. Each project can have its own set of dependencies without interfering with other projects.
Dependency Management: You can easily manage project dependencies using a requirements.txt file, which lists all the packages required for your project.
Consistency: Virtual environments ensure consistency across different development environments and make it easier to replicate the development environment on other machines.

Creating a Virtual Environment in Visual Studio Code
You can open your project folder in Visual Studio Code.
Open the integrated terminal by selecting View > Terminal from the menu or pressing Ctrl + (backtick).
Create a virtual environment using the following command:
#bash
python -m venv venv
This command creates a directory named 'venv' containing the virtual environment.
#Activate the virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate

#Installing Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, you can now install project dependencies using pip. For example:

pip install -r requirements.txt
